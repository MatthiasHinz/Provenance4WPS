# Provenance4WPS
A software prototype that enhances Web Processing Services with provenance-functionality using the Open Provenance Toolkit (OPM). It makes use of the 52Â°North Web Processing Service (WPS) and WPS client libraries. Provenance graphs are visualized using GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org/), as well as using Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/) with an OPM-plugin.

I created this software in conjunction with my Bachelor's Thesis 'Concepts towards a provenance-aware Web Processing Service', submitted in July 2012.
